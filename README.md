**Description**: Trading strategy created in CPZ AI Strategy Lab

**Strategy Type**: Momentum | **Implementation Date**: 11/12/2025 | **Status**: Development

## Overview

This repository contains a momentum trading strategy implementation based on quantitative analysis and systematic market research. The strategy is designed to identify and exploit market inefficiencies while maintaining robust risk management protocols.

### Key Features

- Quantitative signal generation using mathematical models
- Risk-adjusted portfolio construction with dynamic position sizing
- Real-time execution framework with transaction cost optimization
- Comprehensive performance analytics and reporting
- Multi-layered risk controls and position limits
- Extensive backtesting with statistical validation

### Target Performance Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Sharpe Ratio | > 1.5 |
| Maximum Drawdown | < 15% |
| Volatility Target | 12-18% annualized |
| Rebalancing | Daily/Weekly |
| Minimum Capital | $100,000+ |

## Research Hypothesis

**Primary Hypothesis (H₁)**: Securities exhibiting superior relative performance over intermediate time horizons (3-12 months) will continue to outperform in subsequent periods, driven by behavioral biases and institutional flow dynamics.

**Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: Past price performance has no predictive power for future returns beyond what would be expected from random market movements.

**Alternative Hypotheses**:
- **H₁ₐ**: Cross-sectional momentum exhibits stronger persistence than time-series momentum
- **H₁ᵦ**: Momentum effects are amplified during periods of low market volatility  
- **H₁ᶜ**: Risk-adjusted momentum (accounting for volatility) provides superior risk-return profiles

## Theoretical Framework

### Behavioral Finance Foundation
The momentum anomaly finds its theoretical grounding in systematic behavioral biases that pervade financial markets. **Anchoring bias** causes investors to anchor to recent price levels, creating systematic underreaction to new information. **Confirmation bias** leads to selective information processing that reinforces existing trends, while **herding behavior** among institutional investors creates self-reinforcing price dynamics.

### Market Microstructure Considerations
**Gradual Information Diffusion**: The non-instantaneous nature of price discovery creates exploitable inefficiencies as information slowly permeates through different market participant segments. **Institutional Flow Dynamics** generate sustained price pressure as large institutional trades are executed over extended periods. **Risk Management Constraints** such as VaR limits and tracking error constraints create momentum in institutional positioning.

## Research Methodology

### Phase I: Universe Construction & Data Preprocessing

**Security Selection Criteria**:
- Market capitalization > $1B (liquidity filter)
- Average daily volume > $10M (execution feasibility constraint)  
- Price > $5 (penny stock exclusion)
- Exclude recent IPOs (<12 months) and pending delistings

### Phase II: Signal Construction & Factor Engineering

**Momentum Score Calculation**:
```
Momentum Score = (P_t / P_{t-n}) - 1
where n ∈ {63, 126, 252} trading days
```

## Implementation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- 16GB+ RAM recommended
- Stable internet connection for data feeds

### Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/emmalebon57/strategy-my-momentum-emma.git
cd strategy-my-momentum-emma

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
# venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration

If your strategy requires API keys (e.g., for premium data providers), create a `.env` file and load it with `python-dotenv`.

### Quick Start

```python
from strategy import MymomentumemmaStrategy

# Initialize strategy
strategy = MymomentumemmaStrategy()

# Load data and run backtest
data = strategy.load_data(['SPY', 'QQQ'], '2020-01-01', '2023-12-31')
results = strategy.backtest(data)
strategy.generate_report(results)
```

---

## Backtesting Framework

### Validation Process

- **Historical Analysis**: 10+ years of market data
- **Walk-Forward Testing**: 12-month optimization with 6-month validation
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: 10,000+ scenarios for statistical significance
- **Stress Testing**: Performance during market crashes and volatility spikes

### Transaction Cost Modeling

- Realistic bid-ask spreads and market impact
- Dynamic slippage based on order size and liquidity
- Optimal execution strategies (TWAP, VWAP)

## Risk Assessment & Critical Limitations

### **MOMENTUM CRASH RISK** 🔴
**Mechanism**: Rapid mean reversion during market stress periods when momentum portfolios experience severe drawdowns
**Historical Evidence**: March 2009 momentum crash (-79% while value gained +35%)
**Mitigation Strategy**: Dynamic volatility scaling and momentum speed indicators

## Performance Monitoring Framework

### Primary Performance Indicators

| **Metric** | **Target Range** | **Calculation Method** | **Interpretation** |
|------------|------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| **Information Ratio** | 0.5 - 1.2 | (Rₚ - Rᵦ) / σ(Rₚ - Rᵦ) | Risk-adjusted active return efficiency |
| **Maximum Drawdown** | < 25% | max(Peak - Trough) / Peak | Worst-case loss scenario |
